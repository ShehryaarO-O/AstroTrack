# üöÄ AstroTrack

AstroTrack is a research-grade data science and astronomy project focused on the orbital analysis of asteroids using real-world observational data. It combines astrophysical modeling, statistical inference, and deep learning to impute missing values, engineer orbital features, detect anomalies, and predict object classes ‚Äî all while respecting the scientific nature of the domain.

---

## üì¶ Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises observations of 4,500+ asteroids with 22 core orbital features:

- 3 Categorical & 19 Numerical columns
- Key features include: Mean Anomaly, Ascending Node Longitude, Perihelion Argument, Velocity, Distance, and Epoch Times
- Approximately **25‚Äì30%** missing data

---

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis

- Visualized inter-feature relationships to guide imputation logic
- Analyzed missing value patterns based on date ordering
- Used astronomical insights to construct hypotheses and confirm statistical relationships

---

## üßÆ Feature Imputation (Mathematically Driven)

AstroTrack goes beyond basic imputation by reconstructing missing data with physics-based equations:

### 1. ‚è±Ô∏è Time Features
- Derived `year`, `month`, `day` from `Epoch Close Approach`
- Forward-filled missing date values using ordered observations
- Created a unified **Unix timestamp** column

### 2. üåÄ Orbital Geometry

Used orbital mechanics formulas to recover missing values:

- **Mean Motion (n)** and **Semi-Major Axis (a)**:

  \[
  n = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{a^3}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad a = \left(\frac{GM}{n^2}\right)^{1/3}
  \]

- **Eccentricity (e)**:

  \[
  e = \frac{r_a - a}{a}
  \]

- **Inclination (i)** from Tisserand's Parameter:

  \[
  T_j = \frac{a_J}{a} + 2\cos(i) \sqrt{\frac{a(1 - e^2)}{a_J}} \Rightarrow
  i = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{T_j - \frac{a_J}{a}}{2\sqrt{\frac{a(1 - e^2)}{a_J}}}\right)
  \]

- **MICE Imputer** used after formulaic recovery to refine feature correlation estimates.

### 3. üöÄ Velocity & Distance Normalization

- Standardized all units of 3 velocity and 4 distance columns
- Used inter-feature mapping (e.g., continuous to categorical and vice versa) to infer missing entries
- Averaged cleaned columns into unified numerical `velocity` and `distance`

### 4. ‚åõ Temporal Dynamics

Applied:

\[
M = n(t - \tau)
\]

Where:
- \( M \) = Mean Anomaly
- \( t \) = Epoch Osculation
- \( \tau \) = Perihelion Time

- Imputed via linear regression + interpolation
- Categorical Orbital Period was mapped to numerical form via theoretical values and violin plot validation

### 5. üß≠ Spatial Parameters

- `Perihelion Argument` & `Ascending Node Longitude` imputed via regression
- Evaluated via Recursive SHAP value analysis to determine their final model relevance

---

### 6. ‚ùì Orbital Uncertainty (Reconstructed Physically)

Original uncertainty data was sparse and unreliable. Reconstructed using:

#### a. Heliocentric Distance (\( r \)) via Cosine Law:

\[
r = \sqrt{r_1^2 + r_2^2 - 2r_1r_2\cos(\theta)}
\]

#### b. Velocity (\( v \)) via Vis-Viva Equation:

\[
v = \sqrt{GM\left(\frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a}\right)}
\]

#### c. Compute Perturbations:

\[
\Delta r, \Delta v \Rightarrow \Delta P, \Delta \tau
\]

#### d. Final MPC-Based Uncertainty Index:

\[
U = \log_{10} \left( \Delta P^2 + \Delta \tau^2 \right)
\]

Mapped to:
- 0‚Äì3 ‚Üí Low
- 4‚Äì5 ‚Üí Medium
- 6+  ‚Üí High
